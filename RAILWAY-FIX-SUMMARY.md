# Railway Deployment Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Server.js Syntax Errors ✅
- **Problem**: Incomplete try/catch blocks in PUT and DELETE endpoints
- **Solution**: Added proper error handling with try/catch blocks around all DELETE operations
- **Result**: Server.js now has clean syntax with no compilation errors

### 2. Express Server Configuration ✅
- **Problem**: Previous json-server dependency causing conflicts
- **Solution**: Complete Express.js implementation with static file serving
- **Features**:
  - Static file serving from `/public` directory
  - Full CRUD API endpoints for contacts, events, and login details
  - Proper error handling and logging
  - CORS headers for API requests
  - Health check endpoint at `/health`

### 3. Railway Configuration ✅
- **railway.toml**: Configured with proper start command and environment
- **package.json**: Clean dependencies (only Express), valid JSON structure
- **.npmrc**: Optimized for production builds

### 4. API Configuration ✅
- **config.js**: Set to use relative URLs for production (same domain deployment)
- **data-manager.js**: Configured to work with Railway's domain structure
- **Result**: Frontend will automatically use Railway's domain for API calls

## Deployment Status

✅ **Server Code**: Fixed syntax errors, full Express implementation
✅ **Configuration**: Railway, package.json, npmrc all optimized
✅ **Static Files**: All HTML, CSS, JS files properly in `/public` directory
